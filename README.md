# Example-Curio
Random web experiments

Try something out, see what you can do with basic code. Extend it to the nth degree. Experiment with a library you have never tried before. Break some eggs and some code. So what if it glitches or creates an endless loop. Nothing ventured nothing learned.
<ul>
  <li>Clone the repo and place your files in the file structure; link your assets appropriately</li>
  <li>Make a plan of what you want achieve, be prepared to abandon that plan mid project</li>
  <li>Create a single page or multiple pages if it serves the purpose of your curio</li>
  <li>Make it interactive! (CSS :hover is technically all it takes, but I think you can do better)</li>
  <li>link your page to the home navigation</li>
  <li>Create a link on the index.html page to your design</li>
  <li>Create a pull request</li>
</ul>
