# Example-Curio
Random web experiments

Try something out, see what you can do with basic code. Extend it to the nth degree. Experiment with a library you have never tried before. Break some eggs and some code. So what if it glitches or creates an endless loop. Nothing ventured nothing learned.

-Clone the repo and place your files in the file structure; link your assets appropriately
-Make a plan of what you want achieve, be prepared to abandon that plan mid project
-Create a single page or multiple pages if it serves the purpose of your curio
-Make it interactive! (CSS :hover is technically all it takes, but I think you can do better)
-link your page to the home navigation
-Create a link on the index.html page to your design
-Create a pull request
